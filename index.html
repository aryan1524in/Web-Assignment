                What is Extranet:<br>
                • An extranet is a private network that uses Internet technologies to 
                extend a part of an organization's internal network to authorized users 
                outside the organization. It allows for controlled access to specific 
                resources, typically shared between an organization and its external 
                partners, suppliers, customers, or other stakeholders. Unlike the public 
                Internet, access to an extranet is restricted, providing a secure and 
                collaborative platform for external collaboration.<br>
                How is Extranet Implemented:<br>
                • a. Access Control: - Extranets use secure authentication mechanisms to control access, often employing 
                usernames, passwords, or more advanced methods such as multi-factor authentication (MFA). - Role-based 
                access control (RBAC) ensures that users have appropriate permissions based on their roles within the 
                organization.<br>
                • b. Encryption:- Similar to intranets, extranets use encryption protocols like SSL/TLS to secure data 
                transmission over the network. - This ensures that sensitive information exchanged between parties remains 
                confidential.<br>

                updates, reports, and other relevant data.<br>
                
                What is a Web Browser?<br>
                • A web browser is a software application that allows users to access and 
                navigate the World Wide Web (WWW). It interprets and renders web 
                content, including text, images, videos, and interactive elements, 
                presented on web pages. Users interact with the browser through a 
                graphical user interface (GUI) to view, navigate, and interact with 
                websites and online content.<br>
                How Does a Web Browser Work?<br>
                • User Interface: - The browser presents a user interface that includes a 
                URL (Uniform Resource Locator) or address bar, back and forward 
                buttons, bookmarks, and other navigation tools.<br>
                • Rendering Engine: - The rendering engine is a core component of the 
                browser that interprets and displays web content. Different browsers 
                may use different rendering engines (e.g., Blink in Chrome, Gecko in 
                Firefox, WebKit in Safari).<br>
                • HTTP/HTTPS Protocols: - Browsers use the HTTP (Hypertext Transfer 
                Protocol) or its secure version, HTTPS, to request and retrieve web 
                pages from servers.<br>
                • User Input and Navigation: - Users enter URLs or click on links, and the 
                browser translates these actions into requests for specific web pages.
                How Does a Web Browser Work?<br>
                • DNS Resolution: - The browser uses the Domain Name System (DNS) to resolve human-readable domain 
                names (e.g., www.example.com) into IP addresses, allowing it to locate the web server hosting the requested 
                content.<br>
                • HTTP Requests: - The browser sends HTTP requests to the web server identified by the IP address, asking for 
                the requested web page or resource.<br>
                • Server Response: - The web server processes the request and sends back an HTTP response, which includes 
                the requested content (HTML, images, stylesheets, scripts, etc.).<br>
                • Rendering and Display: - The rendering engine interprets the received content, displaying it on the user's 
                screen according to the HTML and CSS specifications.<br>
                • JavaScript Execution: -If the web page contains JavaScript code, the browser's JavaScript engine executes it, 
                enabling dynamic and interactive features on the page.<br>
                • Storage and Caching: - Browsers may store certain elements of web pages locally in caches to improve load 
                times and reduce server requests.<br>
                • Security Features: - Browsers incorporate security features like SSL/TLS for encrypted connections, sandboxing 
                for isolating processes, and warnings for potentially unsafe sites.<br>
                • Plug-ins and Extensions: -Users can enhance browser functionality with plug-ins or extensions that add 
                features, modify behavior, or provide additional tools.<br>
